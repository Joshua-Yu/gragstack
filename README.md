RAGG - Retrieval Augmented Generation over Graph

**RAGGStack: Unleashing the Power of Knowledge with Large Language Models**

🚀 **Introducing RAGGStack** 🚀

Experience an unparalleled leap in open-source intelligence platforms: RAGGStack! Seamlessly integrating Retrieval Augmented Generation over a Graph of Knowledge, this platform now boasts integration with Large Language Models (LLMs), transforming your interaction with vast expanses of data into meaningful dialogues, without the need of writing ANY code!

🌌 **Features**:

- **Automated data ingestion**: Simply drop files of supported format, or point to a data source to start ingesting required data into the knowledge graph, and have text embeddings generated and stored right afterwards. 
- **Dynamic Knowledge Mapping**: Navigate the interconnected web of data, both structured and un-structured, with the advanced Graph of Knowledge, visualizing complex relationships with ease.
- **LLM Augmented Retrievals**: Harness the prowess of state-of-the-art Large Language Models to dive deeper into data lakes, uncovering gems of insights with natural, human-like responses.
- **Swift and Contextual Insights**: Benefit from AI-driven data retrieval that doesn't just fetch information but contextualizes it, offering clarity amidst information chaos.
- **Generative Augmentation**: Beyond retrieval, watch as AI crafts, innovates, and augments data, presenting fresh perspectives and solutions derived from extensive data realms.
- **Open architecture**: The Stack provides ready-to-use integration and easy extension for any LLMs of your choice, either via API or locally-hosted finetuned LLMs.
- **Community-Powered Evolution**: RAGGStack thrives on community. Being open-sourced means you're not just using a tool; you're part of a dynamic, evolving ecosystem.

🛠️ **Inclusive Development**:
RAGGStack's spirit lies in community-driven innovation. Whether you're improving the core, refining the LLM integrations, or just suggesting tweaks, your voice shapes RAGGStack's destiny.

💼 **Use Cases**:
RAGGStack's purpose is to simplify the integration and deployment of LLM powered application over knowledge graph, to remove the general challenges of LLMs in terms of  hallucination, bias, data currency and explanabilty.

Potential use cases are: 
- augmented search
- chatbot
- Q&A over documents
- Natural language based data discovery
- ... (you name the next)
